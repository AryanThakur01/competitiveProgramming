// Verdict: Shows wehther the programme is accepted or not

// Compilation Error: Syntax error

// Memory limit excceded: when the code ask for the memory more than the limit of memory

// Runtime Error: 
    // 1. do not try to access the location which is inaccessible to code like trying to access 12 element of the array of size 10
    // 2.try not to access negative index (not allowed in c/c++)
    // 3.zero division error

// Time limit exceeded: 
// compilation and execution times are different and the competitive programmin contests do not include the compilation time limit.
// Size of the code doesn't affect the execution time of the code
// We will study how to solve the problem of time limit exceeded


// Recurrision code errors:
// Time limit exceeded can occur here too
// stack is used to store the functions where Functions are stored in stack. And it too have an upperlimit.Once the stack is full, this is a Runtime error
